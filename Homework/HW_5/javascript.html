    <H1>How to make bomb guac </h1>
    <div id="step1">
    <h2>Step 1: Get the ingredients!!!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ripe avocados</li>
      <li>1 medium red onion</li>
      <li>1 jalapeño pepper</li>
      <li>1 lime</li>
      <li>Goya® Adobo seasoning</li>
      <li>a pinch of ground cumin</li>
      <li>chili powder</li>
      <li>garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="step2">
    <h2>Step 2: Prepare the fixins!!</h2>
    <p>First, you must cut the avocados without slicing open your hand. The is the most important step because if not you will ruin the guac with your blood. It is also important to recognize that a ripe avocado feels soft to the touch but not mushy. Cut the two avocados in half, then remove the pit and place in a medium size mixing bowl. Next, you must mince half of the red onion along with the entire jalapeno then, add the ingredients to the mixing bowl. After this, juice an entire lime into the mixing bowl.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="step3">
    <h2>Step 3: Mash the f*** out of it</h2>
    <p>Here you're gonna wanna truly pulverize the avocados into what is essential a paste. It always helps to rotate the bowl as you are mashing, thus ensuring that all flavors are well encorporated. </p>
    <p>Next, you can add the spices to taste, I find that less is often more and subtlety allows the flavor and richness of the avocado to shine through. HOWEVER, only use a pinch of the cumin otherwise it will overwhelm the rest of the flavors of the dish. Once you have done that, and the guacamole is in a paste consistency, give it one last mix.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Step 4: Serve and share (or don't)</h2>
    <p> the best part of making awesome guac is sharing! said no one. EVER. Honestly, if I were you I'd get a family sized bag of chips and kill the entire mixing bowl on my own. But totally your call, you could definitely share too, there will be more than enough for 2-4 to share.
